# AI Python for Beginners #1 & #2

Complete the tutorials at https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/ai-python-for-beginners/ . (I just used my Google ID to sign up for an account.) Use this repository to turn in your completed notebooks for assignment credit. Some of the lessons are just videos, but some lessons have attached notebooks you should complete as you watch the videos. Turn in a completed notebook for each of the videos listed below to receive full credit.

## AI Python for Beginners: Basics of AI Python Coding

This lesson will start automatically when you first log into the site. The first few videos don't have an associated notebook, but still watch the videos anyway.

* Lesson 4: Running your first program
* Lesson 6: Data in Python
* Lesson 7: Combining text and calculations
* Lesson 8: Variables
* Lesson 9: Building LLM prompts with variables
* Lesson 10: Functions: Actions on data

## AI Python for Beginners: Automating Tasks with Python

You'll need to click on the Course Syllabus link and select the second course in the series (AI Python for Beginners: Automating Tasks with Python) to get to the next set up tutorials.

* Lesson 1: Completing a task list with AI
* Lesson 2: Repeating tasks with for loops
* Lesson 3: Prioritizing tasks with dictionaries and AI
* Lesson 4: Customizing recipies with lists, dictionaries, and AI
* Lesson 5: Comparing data in Python
* Lesson 6: Helping AI make decisions
* Lesson 7: Next course preview: Working with files

You can complete the notebooks directly in the tutorial interface. You can download a completed notebook by going to File - Download as - Notebook (.ipynb) before moving onto the next. You can then upload your notebook file to your GitHub repository.

There are two more short courses that came out in September. You don't need to complete them here.

## AI Python for Beginners: Working with Your Own Data and Documents in Python

This is the third course. I'll create a separate optional assignment for these notebooks.

## AI Python for Beginners: Extending Python with Packages and APIs

This is the fourth course. I'll create a separate optional assignment for these notebooks.


DeepLearning.AI sends out a regular newsletter where Andres Ng talks about emerging trends in AI and notifications when new tutorials are released. I've found a number of the tutorials informative.
